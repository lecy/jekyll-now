Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

Here is some code

```r
x <- 1:10
y <- rnorm(10)

plot( x, y )
```

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
